This project is a plugin that automatically switches the theme of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a note-taking app that uses plain text files with markdown and interlinking capabilities. The plugin allows users to customize their preferred themes for day and night modes, and set the time intervals for switching. The plugin also detects the systemâ€™s dark mode settings and adjusts accordingly. The plugin was developed using Typescript and CSS, and was tested on Windows, and Mac OS.

This project was inspired from the JetBrains [Day And Night](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12006-day-and-night) plugin by Ignat Bavtovich
