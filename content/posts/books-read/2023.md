These yearly posts keep getting posted later and later ðŸ˜…. Regardless, here is a list of books I read in 2023. Last year (technically 2 years ago), I read a lot of fictionâ€”eight books, to be exact. Compared to that, this year had a good mix of fiction and non-fiction, with four and six books, respectively. According to Goodreads, my average rating for 2023 was 4 stars, which isnâ€™t surprising considering that the books Iâ€™ve read are either critically acclaimed (e.g., "The Martian") or were highly praised by subject matter experts (SMEs) (see "Chip War," "Cobalt Red," "Money Go Up"). "Chip War" and "Mind Hunter" each earned a 5-star rating from me.

"Chip War" provides an excellent account of the history of modern semiconductor chips, the heavy government influence, and how the semiconductor industry is simultaneously global and not very global. All of this has culminated in the current silent cold war we are fighting with China.

"Mind Hunter" offers a fascinating look into the development of criminal profiling at the FBI. The book provides a unique insight into the minds of serial killers to better understand how the mind of a serial killer functions and the psychology behind catching these criminals. I also canâ€™t recommend the [Netflix TV show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5290382/) based on the book enough.
